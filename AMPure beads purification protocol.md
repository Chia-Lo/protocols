#AMPure XP beads DNA purification

##Equipment
* 1.5 ml tubes;
* magnet plate for 1.5 ml tubes;
* set of automatic pipettes ranging from 10 µl and 1 ml.

##Reagents
* AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter);
* 70% EtOH;
* Elution buffer - EB (Qiagen).

##Workflow
1| Add 0.8 μl AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) per 1.0 μl of sample. Mix well by pipetting. Incubate sample for 5 minutes at room temperature 
for maximum recovery.

**CRITICAL STEP:** Before adding shake well the Agencourt AMPure XP beads to resuspend any magnetic particles that may have
settled. 

2| Place the tube with the sample into magnet plate for 2 minutes to separate beads from the solution.

**CRITICAL STEP:** Wait for the solution to clear before proceeding to the next step.

3| Aspirate the cleared solution from the reaction plate and discard.

**CRITICAL STEP:** Do not disturb the spot of separated magnetic beads.

4| Add 200 μl 70% EtOH and incubate 30 seconds at room temperature. Aspirate out the ethanol and discard. 

5| Repeat step 4 (optional).

6| Open the lid. Dry the tube with beads 3 minutes at room temperature.

**NOTE:** A dry time is optional to ensure all traces of EtOH are removed. Do not over dry the beads as this will significantly
decrease elution efficiency.

7| Add 40 μl of elution buffer - EB (Qiagen). Mix well by pipetting. Incubate sample for 5 minutes at room temperature.

8| Place the tube with the sample into magnet plate for 2 minutes to separate beads from the solution.

9| Transfer the eluate witn DNA to a new tube.
