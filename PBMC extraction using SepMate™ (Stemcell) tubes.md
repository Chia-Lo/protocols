##Equipment
* SepMate™ tubes - 15 or 50 ml (Stemcell);
* 15 or 50 ml tubes;
* set of automatic pipettes ranging from 1 ml and 50 ml;
* centrifuge.

##Reagents
* Ficoll density gradient medium;
* Hanks medium;
* PBS + 0.5% BSA;
* RosetteSep™ [B-](http://www.stemcell.com/en/Products/All-Products/RosetteSep-Human-B-Cell-Enrichment-Cocktail.aspx)
  or [T-](http://www.stemcell.com/en/Products/All-Products/RosetteSep-Human-T-Cell-Enrichment-Cocktail.aspx) 
  or [Total lymphocyte enrichment coctail](http://www.stemcell.com/en/Products/All-Products/RosetteSep-Human-Total-Lymphocyte-Enrichment-Cocktail.aspx) (Stemcell). Optional.
  
##Procedure
1| Add density gradient medium to the SepMate™ tube by carefully pipetting it through the central hole of the SepMate™
insert. Refer to Table 1 for required volumes. The top of the density gradient medium will be above the insert.

**Table 1.** Density gradient volumes.

| SepMate™ tube | Initial blood, ml | Ficoll, ml |
| ------------- |:-----------------:| ----------:|
| 15            | 0.5 - 4.0         | 4.5        |
| 15            | 4 - 5             | 3.5        |
| 50            | 5 - 17            | 15         |

**NOTE:** Small bubbles may be present in the density gradient medium after pipetting. This will not affect performance.

2| Optional step. Add appropriate volume of RosetteSep™ enrichment coctail to the blood sample. Mix gently. Incubate for 20 minutes at room temperature.

**NOTE:** The RosetteSep™ Enrichment Cocktail is designed to enrich lymphocytes from whole blood by negative selection. 
Unwanted cells are targeted for removal with Tetrameric Antibody Complexes recognizing CD16, CD36, CD66b and glycophorin A 
on red blood cells (RBCs). When centrifuged over a density gradient, the unwanted cells pellet along with the RBCs. 
The purified lymphocytes are present as a highly enriched population at the interface between the plasma and 
the density medium. 

**NOTE:** This step is strongly recommended for high quality FACS sorting of small and rare lymphocyte populations. 

3| Dilute sample with an equal volume of Hanks medium. Mix gently.

4| Keeping the SepMate™ tube vertical, carefully add the diluted sample by pipetting it down the side of the tube.

**CRITICAL STEP:** Take care not to pour the diluted sample directly through the central hole.

5| Centrifuge at 1200 g for 20 minutes at room temperature, with the brake off.

6| Aspirate the top layer (diluted plasma).

7| Pour off the interphase, which contains the enriched lymphocytes, into a new tube. 

**NOTE:** Some red blood cells (RBCs) may be present on the surface of the SepMate™ insert after centrifugation. This will
not affect performance. 

8| Wash enriched lymphocytes with 50 ml Hanks medium.

**NOTE:** Centrifuging at 400 g for 30 minutes at room temperature, with the brake on, is recommended.

9| Optional step. Repeat step 8.

10| Transfer cells to 1-2 ml PBS + 0.5% BSA.

**NOTE:** Washing with 5 ml PBS + 0.5% BSA, centrifuging at 400 g for 8 minutes at room temperature, with the brake on, 
is recommended.

11| Count cells.
