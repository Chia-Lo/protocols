##Equipment
 * 1.5 ml tubes;
 * set of automatic pipettes ranging from 1 µl and 1 ml;
 * centrifuge.
 
##Reagents
 * 80% EtOH;
 * Trizol (Invitrogen) or QIAzol (QIAGEN), or other analogous products;
 * steril RNAse free water;
 * chloroform;
 * isopropanol;
 * Pellet Paint® co-precipitant (optional).
 
##Procedure
1| Add 1 ml of Trizol to your suspension of mononuclear cells and pipette extensively for the liquid to become transparent.

**CRITICAL STEP:** Improper ratio Trizol reagent: sample may lead to insufficient cell lysis and affect the RNA yield. Use correct amount of lysis reagent. For example, use 1 ml of Trizol per up to 10^7 cells.

2| Add 200 µl of chloroform. Shake well. 

3| Centrifuge at max speed for 20 minutes at +4.

4| Transfer the tubes on ice. While keeping the tube cool, transfer the upper phase into a new tube.

5| Add 1 µl of co-precipitant (optional) and 500 µl isopropanol.

6| Centrifuge at max speed for 20 minutes at +4.

7| Discard the supernatant.

8| Add 200 µl  80% EtOH.

9| Centrifuge at max speed for 2 minutes at +4.

10| Repeat steps 7-9 (optional).

11| Discard the supernatant.

12| Place the tube opened at 50 degrees. As soon as EtOH evaporates take the tube off the thermostat.

**CRITICAL STEP:** Do not overdry RNA - it leads to a decrease in recovery. 

13| Dilute RNA in steril RNAse free water.

14| Check the amount and quality of RNA using gel-electrophoresis.
